### SQL Statements

- SQL transaction Statements    

### Data Dictionary
All database elements created via SQL schema statements are stored in a special set of tables called the ***data dictionary*** - Data about the database

### Non-procedural

SQL is a **non-procedural** language in that you may control the results, however, you may not control the way the process of doing so is done.
