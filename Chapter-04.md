### SQL built-in functions

SQL has many built-in functions.

- `LEFT()`
- `NOW()`
- `LOWER()`
- `UPPER()`

Comparisons to make when filtering data:
- Exact comparison
- Within a range
- In a set
- Partial string match - Wildcard characters or REGEX expressions.

Use the `LIKE` keyword to do a partial string match.
| Wildcard character | Matches |
|--------------------|---------|
|  _ | Exactly one character |
| %  | Any number of characters (including 0) |

> ðŸ’€ NULL - An expression can be NULL, but it can never equal NULL - Two nulls are never equal to each other.
